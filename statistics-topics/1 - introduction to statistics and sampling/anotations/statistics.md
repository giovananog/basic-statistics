<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p>Statistics is a science that provides methods for the collection, organization, description, analysis, and interpretation of data (observational or experimental) and for their use in decision-making.</p>
<h2>Division</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>
        <p>Descriptive Statistics can be defined as a set of techniques aimed at describing and summarizing data so that we can explore the characteristics of interest. Generally, we use Descriptive Statistics in the initial stage of the analysis when we first encounter the data.</p>
        <p>Steps: data collection → data evaluation → data presentation (tables, graphs, statistical measures)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Probability</strong>
        <p>Probability can be thought of as the mathematical theory used to study the uncertainty arising from phenomena involving chance (random phenomena or random experiments).</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Statistical Inference</strong>
        <p>Statistical Inference is the study of techniques that enable the extrapolation (inference) to a large set of data (population) from information and conclusions obtained from usually much smaller subsets of values (samples).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Scientific Methodology</h2>
<p>Science, in general, aims to collect information (facts) in nature and formulate models (or hypotheses) that explain part of the phenomena or allow their prediction. This process is based on criteria well defined by the scientific method, by which formulated hypotheses are subsequently verified with the collection and interpretation of data. However, this methodology is widely applied beyond the scientific realm.</p>

    <li><strong>Stages of Scientific Methodology</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>The problem to be solved (Motivation)</li>
            <li>Search in theory to support ideas, possible solutions</li>
            <li>Formulation of hypotheses</li>
            <li>Verification of whether the hypotheses are true or false. At this stage, the use of data, which can be observational or experimental, is necessary.</li>
            <li>Analysis of results</li>
            <li>Comparison with existing theories and conclusions</li>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Population</strong>: a set of elements (individuals or objects) that share at least one common characteristic.</li>
    <li><strong>Sample</strong>: a finite and representative subset of the population.</li>
    <li><strong>Census</strong>: collection of data related to all elements of the population.</li>
    <li><strong>Random Variable</strong>: can be defined as any characteristic of interest associated with a population or sample to be studied. These can be classified as:
        <ul>
            <li>Qualitative ⇒
                <ul>
                    <li>Ordinal</li>
                    <li>Nominal</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Quantitative ⇒
                <ul>
                    <li>Discrete</li>
                    <li>Continuous</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Types of Variables</strong>: variables can be:
        <ul>
            <li>a) Qualitative Variable: attributes or categories, can be:
                <ul>
                    <li>a.1) Qualitative nominal variable: when attributes (or categories) cannot be ordered.</li>
                    <li>a.2) Qualitative ordinal variable: when attributes (or categories) can be ordered.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>b) Quantitative Variable: variables that correspond to numbers resulting from counting or measurements, can be:
                <ul>
                    <li>b.1) Quantitative discrete variable: specific to count data, i.e., defined in an enumerable set.</li>
                    <li>b.2) Quantitative continuous variable: those in which realizations result from a measurement that can take any real value between two extremes. (in a real interval). Example: weight and height of students in a class.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data or Observation</strong>: the value (or attribute) that describes a characteristic of the sample.</li>
    <li><strong>Parameter</strong>: the numerical measure that describes a characteristic of the population.</li>

<h2>Population</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unit or System</strong>
        <p>A unit or system is a set of related entities (elements) that constitute an organized whole globally and
            dynamically related to the external environment, performing some function together.</p>
        <p>Example: In a study on the incidence of brucellosis in animals in a region, the unit could be an animal,
            a herd, a farm, a district, or a municipality.</p>
        <p>The complete definition of a unit or system should cover the six aspects listed in the characterization
            following its definition:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Function or objectives of the unit;</li>
            <li>Inputs - elements that enter the unit;</li>
            <li>Outputs - elements that leave the unit;</li>
            <li>Components - internal elements that transform inputs into outputs;</li>
            <li>Flow - movement of elements between the components of the unit;</li>
            <li>Boundary or limit - imaginary line that demarcates and includes all its components and elements.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Target Population</strong>
        <p>In scientific research, the target population, or simply the population, is the well-defined collection of
            units (systems) of interest for which establishing relationships or making inferences is desired. The number
            of units is called the population size.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real Population (units can be identified)</li>
            <li>Conceptual Population (units are not identifiable but defined by the characterization of the conditions
                for integration)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Descriptive (Observational) Research Methods</h2>
<p>Descriptive or observational research methods, also called surveys, are suitable for descriptive research, providing a
    description of the behavior of units in a target population by identifying and describing the relevant
    characteristics of these units and the relationships between these characteristics. They can occur at two levels:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Elementary Level</strong>
        <p>Descriptive research focuses only on the measurement of characteristics and determination of their important
            properties, such as means and variances, or frequency distributions.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Level</strong>
        <p>It aims not only to describe characteristics but also to identify and describe relationships of association or
            correlation of characteristics (variables), i.e., relationships of characteristics that vary together.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sampling</h2>
<p>A study can be conducted on all units of the target population or on a fraction of that population, i.e., on a
    sample of the target population.</p>
<p>As it is not always possible to study all individuals in the population due to limited resources or time constraints,
    the sampling method is used, which consists of obtaining an opinion on the total (universe) by compiling and
    examining only a part, the sample, selected by scientific procedures. The value of this system will depend on the
    sample:</p>
<ul>
    <li>if it is sufficiently representative or significant;</li>
    <li>if it contains all characteristic traits in a proportion relative to the population.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Probabilistic Sampling</h3>
<p>A sampling will be probabilistic if all elements of the population have a known, non-zero probability of belonging to
    the sample. Thus, probabilistic sampling implies a draw with well-determined rules, whose realization will only be
    possible if the population is finite and entirely accessible.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Random Sampling (SRS) or Simple Random Sampling</strong>
        <p>Objective: to obtain a representative sample when the elements of the population are all homogeneous with
            respect to characteristics that may influence the variables to be measured or identified.</p>
        <p>Procedure: enumerate all elements of the population (1, 2, ..., N) and draw "n" elements using a random
            device (computer, calculator, table of random numbers, among others).</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stratified Sampling</strong>
        <p>Objective: to improve the representativeness of the sample when the elements of the population are
            heterogeneous but can be grouped into homogeneous subpopulations (strata).</p>
        <p>Procedure: the population is divided into groups or strata containing homogeneous elements, and the samples
            are drawn separately from each of these groups through Simple Random Sampling.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Systematic Sampling</strong>
        <p>Objective: to increase the representativeness of the sample by giving broader coverage to the population. It
            is used when the elements of the population are heterogeneous and cannot be grouped into homogeneous
            sub-populations.</p>
        <p>Procedure: enumerate all elements of the population (1, 2, ..., N), calculate "r," and draw a first element
            to be part of the sample, this between the 1st and the "r-th" element. The others are taken in an arithmetic
            progression, skipping "r" elements, until completing the total sample (n). The value "r" is called the
            sampling step and is determined by:</p>
</ul>
<h3>Non-Probabilistic Sampling</h3>
<p>When not all elements of the population have a different probability than zero of belonging to the sample, we say that
    the sampling is non-probabilistic (i.e., some elements will have no chance of being part of the sample because it is
    not possible to obtain a list of all elements of the population to be surveyed).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purposive Sampling</strong>
        <p>This is the case where the researcher seeks to be "random" without, however, using a rigorous random draw.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Judgmental Sampling</strong>
        <p>In this type of sampling, the sample is taken from the part of the population that is accessible. A distinction is made between the target population (the one in mind when conducting the study) and the sampled population (the part of the population that is accessible). If these two populations have the same characteristics, this type of sampling will be equivalent to probabilistic sampling.</p>

    <h4>Quota Sampling</h4>
    <p>Quota sampling is a form of sampling widely used in market research, electoral, and public opinion surveys. It is a sample that, through quotas, proportionally selects people with similar characteristics from a population.</p>
    <p>To carry out this type of sampling, it is necessary to first segment the studied universe into characteristics. In market research, the most used variables are related to the income and consumption of the interviewees, such as monthly family income, ownership of assets, socioeconomic class, and marital status. In electoral and public opinion surveys, variables such as gender, age group, place of residence, and education are used.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Convenience Sampling</h4>
    <p>Convenience samples are a type of sample that does not require rigorous criteria in the pre-selection of the public to be surveyed. In other words, the universe of the research does not need to be fully defined for it to be carried out.</p>
    <p>As an example, one can imagine a researcher going to a public place, such as the entrance of a University or the entrance of an establishment (Shopping mall, Hospital, etc.), and conducting the survey there, without much control criteria with the sample profile. Thus, the selection will only be with people who passed by, were approached, and agreed to respond to the survey.</p>

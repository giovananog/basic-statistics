# Descriptive Statistics 

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Descriptive statistics is the part of statistics that deals with the organization, presentation,
and analysis of qualitative or quantitative data, whether they are sample or experimental data.</p>

<p>Data presentation is done through some representation, which can be in the form of tables or graphs.</p>

<p>Data analysis is performed by calculating some measures of interest, such as mean and
standard deviation.</p>

<p>The table is a tool that allows a rigorous inspection of the data, being quite efficient to
show the behavior of the data, facilitate the understanding of information, as well as the interpretation of
the studied phenomenon or process.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Always appears at the top of the table and contains information that answers the
                questions of the studied phenomenon, such as: What? Where? When? (Should be explanatory, with the identification
                of the population, and the variable).</li>
            <li><strong>Header:</strong> Indicates the nature of the content of each column: what is being represented in each column
                of the table.</li>
            <li><strong>Body:</strong> Represented by columns in which information is recorded. In these columns, absolute frequencies (Fi), relative frequencies (Fr), and relative frequencies in percentages (Fp) are presented.
                Where: Fi indicates how many times (frequency) a category or value repeats in a data set.
                Fr = Fi / n
                Fp = Fr * 100%
                n: sample size or the sum of all absolute frequencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cells:</strong> Space for a single number.</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> Should be highlighted in some way.</li>
            <li><strong>Source/Footer:</strong> Space at the bottom of the table where notes or data sources can be inserted.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

# Presentation of Qualitative Data

<p>For qualitative data, enumeration (counting) is the simplest way to represent them.
Note: Every table and graph must have an explanatory title (identification of the population and the variable).</p>

<p>The bar chart is a graph in which rectangular bars have a length proportional to the values
they represent (frequency). Bars can be drawn vertically or horizontally. The vertical bar chart is called a column chart.</p>

<p>The pie chart, commonly called a pie chart, is a circular diagram where the values of
each statistical category represented are proportional to the percentage of the occupied area; each "slice" represents a data category and the size is proportional to the quantity it represents.</p>

# Presentation of Discrete Quantitative Data 

<p>In most situations where we have data for discrete quantitative variables (characteristic
of counts), it is common to construct a simpler frequency table, which represents the absolute frequency of each value assumed by the variable (Fi); relative frequencies (Fr); Fr = Fi / n; and
percentage frequencies (Fp); Fp = Fr × 100.</p>

# Organization and Presentation of Continuous Quantitative Data 

<p>Similar to qualitative data, organization of continuous quantitative data is done through representation. The simplest and most used form is the frequency distribution, defined below.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Construction of a Frequency Distribution Table (FDT)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Frequency Distribution: is the distribution of data into classes or categories. The number of elements
associated with each class represents the class frequency.</p>

<p>To summarize the data, it is ideal to create a table and/or a graph. To construct a table with statistical criteria, the following steps should be followed:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Determine the number of classes (K), which can be based on the following criteria:
        <ul>
            <li>a) Researcher's familiarity with the data.</li>
            <li>b) Criterion based on the number of observations (n): what is the ideal number of classes? Oliveira, M. S (1994).
                Number of observations (n) Number of classes (K)
                Up to 100 √
                n (if decimal, use the next integer)
                Above 100 5log (n)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Determine the class width, which will be determined by a statistical criterion: Find the total width
        (A);
        The total width is the difference between the largest and smallest observations.</li>
    <li>Find the width of each class (C);
        The width of each class is the ratio between the total width and the number of classes minus 1.
        C = A / (K - 1)</li>
    <li>Determine the classes: let LIi and LSi be the lower and upper limits of class "i," respectively.
        <ul>
            <li>a) LI1 = smallest observation - C/2.</li>
            <li>b) LI1 is known, so LS1 = LI1 + C.</li>
            <li>c) LI2 = LS1.</li>
            <li>d) LS2 = LI2 + C.
                Continue the previous steps until completing "K" classes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Determine the midpoint of the class (Xi):
        Xi = (LI1 + LS1) / 2;</li>
    <li>Calculate the values of absolute frequencies (Fi);
        For each class, the value of Fi is the number of observations contained in the class.</li>
    <li>Calculate the values of relative frequencies (F ri); F ri = Fi/n</li>
    <li>Calculate the values of percentage frequencies (F pi); F pi = F ri × 100</li>
    <li>Calculate the values of cumulative percentage frequencies (F ACpi); F ACpi = sum of percentage frequencies up to class "i". When of interest.</li>
</ol>

# Graphical Representation of Continuous Quantitative Data 

<ul>
    <li><strong>a) Histogram:</strong> a graph represented by rectangles whose bases are proportional to the class widths
        and heights proportional to the class frequencies (the frequencies can be Fi, F ri, or F pi).</li>
    <li><strong>b) Frequency Polygon:</strong> a graph in which the midpoints of the classes, at the top of the rectangles in the histogram, are joined by lines. The polygon starts and ends at the midpoints of the classes before the first
        and after the last, respectively. </li>
      
    <li>  <h2>Classification of frequency distributions</h2>
        <p> The shape of the frequency polygon allows the classification of the frequency distribution as: symmetrical, skewed to the right, skewed to the left. For this, the polygon must be compared with the curves
        called frequency curves.
        Skewed to the left: mean < median < mode
        Symmetrical: mean = median = mode
        Skewed to the right: mode < median < mean
        </p> </li>
      
</ul>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>

  <h3>Random Experiments</h3>

  <p>
    Random experiments are phenomena produced by humans in which the results are not predictable, even with a large number of repetitions of the same phenomenon.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Examples:</li>
    <li>E1: Rolling a die and recording the number of points.</li>
    <li>E2: Tossing two coins and checking the upper face of each.</li>
    <li>E3: Duration of a battery.</li>
    <li>E4: Recording the number of people using an electronic device.</li>
    <li>E5: Observing the birth of 3 animals, considering the order, and checking their gender.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In random experiments, even if the initial conditions are the same, the final results of each attempt may be different and unpredictable.
  </p>

  <h3>Deterministic Experiments</h3>

  <p>
    In contrast to random experiments, there are deterministic experiments, which are those whose results are predictable. For example, the freezing temperature of water. Since the results of random experiments are not predictable, Statistics expresses the occurrence of these results through probabilities (this is the concept of probability).
  </p>

  <h3>Probabilities</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Classical Probability (a priori): When the probability of the occurrence of a possible result can be known before the experiment.</li>
    <li>Empirical Probability (a posteriori): When the probability of the occurrence of a possible result is determined from a previous experiment.</li>
    <li>Bayesian Probability: When the probability of the occurrence of a possible result is determined from the introduction of prior information, which can be updated or complemented by sample data through Bayes' Theorem, allowing the combination of data information and a priori probability, leading to a posteriori probability.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Sample Space</h3>

  <p>
    The Sample Space, denoted by Ω (or S), represents the set of all possible outcomes associated with a random experiment. The elements of Ω are called sample elements.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Examples of Sample Spaces:</li>
    <li>Ω1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};</li>
    <li>Ω2 = {CC, FC, FF, CF} = {(C, C), (F, C), (F, F), (C, F)};</li>
    <li>Ω3 = R;</li>
    <li>Ω4 = N;</li>
    <li>Ω5 = {MMM, MMF, MFM, MFF, FMM, FMF, FFM, FFF}.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Event</h3>

  <p>
    An event is a set of possible outcomes from which we want to know its probability of occurrence. It is any subset of the sample space, which can be a single sample point or a union of them. It is denoted by an uppercase letter (A, B, C, etc).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Examples:</li>
    <li>i) Elementary Event: When the event consists of a single element;</li>
    <li>ii) Certain Event: Another name for the sample space Ω;</li>
    <li>iii) Impossible Event: When the event contains no elements, that is, it "did not happen" in reality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Probability of an Event P(E)</h2>

  <h3>Priori Probability</h3>

  <p>
    Priori Probability is the ratio between the number of elements of event "E," n(E), and the number of elements of Ω, n(Ω), where n(E) is the number of favorable cases and n(Ω) is the number of possible cases.
  </p>

  <h3>Frequentist Probability</h3>

  <p>
    Frequentist Probability is defined by the relative frequencies of the frequency distribution table, where P(E) is the relative frequency, n(E) is the number of times E occurred, and n is the number of times the experiment was performed.
  </p>

  <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>

  <p>
    Given two events A and B, the conditional probability of A given that B occurred is represented by P(A | B) and is given by the division between the probability of the intersection of A and B and the probability of B .

  <h3>Random Variable and Probability Distribution</h3>

  <p>
    To facilitate the development of probability theory, it is important to associate a number with a random event and calculate the probability of this number occurring instead of the probability of the event. For example, observing the state of 3 laboratory equipment and determining their condition (DEFECT - D or GOOD - B).
  </p>

  <p>
    S = (BBB), (BBD), (BDB), (DBB), (BDD), (DBD), (DDB), (DDD)
  </p>

  <h4>Events:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>E1: Having exactly 2 pieces of equipment in good condition.</li>
    <li>E1: {(BBD), (BDB), (DBB)}</li>
    <li>E2: Having 2 or more pieces of equipment in good condition.</li>
    <li>E2: {(BBB), (BBD), (BDB), (DBB)}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    X = Number of pieces of equipment in good condition, ⇒ x = 0, 1, 2, 3. (Note: Usually, the random variable is represented by an uppercase letter, and the value it assumes by the same lowercase letter).
  </p>

  <p>
    P(E1) = P(X = 2)<br>
    P(E2) = P(X ≥ 2)
  </p>

  <h3>Random Variable</h3>

  <p>
    A random variable is any variable that associates a single real number (or a series of numbers) with each event in the sample space. As each random event is related to a probability of occurrence, each of the possible values of the random variable is also related to a probability of occurrence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notation: Random variables - X, Y, Z (uppercase)
  </p>

  <p>
    Probability that the random variable X takes the value x is represented by P(X = x).
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: By convention, random variables are always quantitative, even when referring to attributes or categories (i.e., qualitative variables).
  </p>

  <h3>Binomial Distribution (Discrete)</h3>

  <p>
    The binomial distribution is often applied to describe situations where the variable of a population under study has two possible responses (success and failure). It is mainly interested in two categories: defective or unsatisfactory item versus good or satisfactory item and success and failure that have occurred in a sample of fixed size.
  </p>

  <p>
    The binomial distribution is applied to events arising from a series of random experiments, which constitute the so-called Bernoulli Process (yes-no responses).
  </p>

  <h3>Poisson Distribution (Discrete)</h3>

  <p>
    It is used when determining probabilities of discrete random variables defined as:
  </p>

  <p>
    X: number of elements (individuals) that occur in a volume, a time interval, or a given surface (number of elements per area, volume, or time, etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: If there is a random variable: the number of elements (individuals) that occur in an interval, in which E(X) has a value far from V(X), Poisson should not be used.
  </p>

  <h3>Continuous Probability Distribution</h3>

  <p>
    It is the probability distribution associated with a continuous random variable. In this case, it is not possible to directly associate a probability of occurrence with each value of the random variable due to the nature of the variable, which has infinitely many values. However, through graphs constructed from the frequency distribution table, it is possible to find a probability density function (pdf) that allows determining the probability that the values of the random variable are within intervals of interest.
  </p>

  <h3>Normal or Gaussian Distribution (Continuous)</h3>

  <p>
    It is the most important distribution of continuous random variables due to its enormous application in various fields of knowledge. "Whatever the random variable under study, it is necessary to first recognize what is the probability density function (pdf) associated with it."
